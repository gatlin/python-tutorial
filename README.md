Python tutorials!
===

At the request of a friend, I am going to be putting up a series of
increasingly sophisticated programming tutorials, using the Python language.

How to get started
---

1. Ensure you have Python installed
2. Ensure you have git installed
3. In your terminal, navigate to a directory you want the code to live in and
   type:

    git clone https://github.com/gatlin/python-tutorial && cd python-tutorial

Organization
---

Each lesson lives in its own folder, helpfully numbered in the right order. You
should first read the code, as the top of each file contains helpful
information.

Then, you should perform the exercises in the file.

New exercises
---

If there are new exercises you would like to try, you can just pull from this
repository.

These aren't perfect but if you submit pull requests with good ideas they'll
get closer!

If you have questions or comments, feel free to contact me at
